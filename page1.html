<h2>My First Assignment-Movie Review</h2>
<p>Arriving on Ellis Island is Newt Scamander, a “magizoologist” (basically Jane Goodall with a wand) who has come to America with only the shirt on his back and a small, leather-bound suitcase that hides an ark full of magical creatures, which are illegal in the U.S. He’s almost immediately waylaid when several beasts from his menagerie escape – they are constantly escaping; he needs better locks on that suitcase – and proceed to wreak havoc on the city.
  He’s arrested, and later befriends a disgraced Auror (a magic cop, for those of you not familiar with the Potterverse) named Tina Goldstein (who seems overwhelmed by her surroundings), her telepath sister, and Jacob, a No-Maj (the American term for “muggle,” meaning a person who can’t use magic), the best non-beast in the overstuffed cast of characters, which also includes a moody teen with a secret, an orphan girl, an ambitious young senator, a brooding Auror, and oh, a cantankerous newspaper baron. And that’s not the half of them.
  But the movie promises fantastic beasts, and fantastic they are. Here we encounter elephants seemingly bred with giant squids; enormous rhinos crossed with whales; jungle cats that puff up like blowfish; snakes with wings that grow and shrink depending on their surroundings; enormous eagles; an invisible monkey-like creature; a Groot-like stick insect; a kleptomaniacal platypus.
  As Newt and his new friends chase the runaway beasts around the city, they become entwined in a variety of half-baked (and rather superfluous) subplots, ranging from the search for a child with wondrous magical abilities, an anti-witchcraft temperance society, and a shadowy figure named Gellert Grindelwald, who has the rest of the wizarding community on edge.</p>
